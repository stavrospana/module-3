Module 3 Random password generator

In this project I had edited the Javascript file to create a random password generator that would generate a 16 digit password using numbers, letters, and also symbols. 
I achieved this by using Math functions and loops to randomly assign each variable specified.
Using the Math.random() function in Java script allowed the program to sort through 16 variations as it generates.
I also added the "onclick" to the button in the HTML file so as the user presses it, it activates the script.
